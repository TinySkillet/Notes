# Research Guide: Building a Data Source Connector Management System

  

This guide outlines the key areas of research and technologies to explore for building a feature that allows content managers to configure and manage data source connectors, starting with Postgres.

### Phase 1: Backend API Development (The Core Logic)

  

The first step is to build the API that will handle the configuration of data sources. Your FastAPI application will need to store, manage, and test these configurations.

  

**1. Data Modeling (SQLAlchemy):**

- **Goal:** Define how to store connection details for various data sources in your database.

- **Research Topics:**

- Create a new SQLAlchemy model, e.g., `DataSourceConnector`.

- Fields to include: `id`, `name` (e.g., "Marketing Prod DB"), `provider` (e.g., "postgres"), `host`, `port`, `username`, `encrypted_password`, `database_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

- Use **Alembic** to create a new database migration for this model.

  

**2. API Endpoints (FastAPI):**

- **Goal:** Create RESTful endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the connectors.

- **Research Topics:**

- **Create a new router:** `app/routers/connectors.py`.

- **`POST /connectors/`**: Create a new connector configuration.

- **`GET /connectors/`**: List all saved connectors (without exposing secrets).

- **`GET /connectors/{connector_id}`**: Get details for a single connector.

- **`PUT /connectors/{connector_id}`**: Update a connector.

- **`DELETE /connectors/{connector_id}`**: Delete a connector.

- **`POST /connectors/test`**: An endpoint that takes connection details and tries to connect to the database to verify them without saving them. This is crucial for a good user experience.

  

**3. Database Connection Logic (Python Libraries):**

- **Goal:** Learn how to connect to an external Postgres database from your Python backend.

- **Libraries to investigate:**

- **`SQLAlchemy`**: Use its Core expression language (`create_engine`, `text()`) to connect to and query external databases dynamically using the stored credentials. This is powerful because you are likely already using it.

- **`psycopg2` / `psycopg` (v3)**: The standard Postgres driver for Python. Understand its connection parameters (`dsn`). `psycopg` offers better support for modern Python features like async.

### Phase 2: Data Ingestion Pipeline

  

Once a connector is configured, you need a process to extract data from it and load it into your knowledge base.

  

**1. Metadata Discovery:**

- **Goal:** How to programmatically discover what tables and columns are available in the user's database.

- **Research Topics:**

- **SQLAlchemy Inspector:** This is a powerful feature. Research `sqlalchemy.inspect(engine)` to get schema names, table names (`get_table_names`), and column information (`get_columns`). This allows you to populate a dropdown in the UI.

  

**2. Data Fetching and Transformation:**

- **Goal:** Define a strategy for pulling data and converting it into a format suitable for your knowledge base (likely text chunks).

- **Research Topics:**

- **Table-to-Document Strategy:** How do you map a structured table to unstructured documents? A common starting point is to let the user select a table and then choose which columns to concatenate into a single text document for each row.

- **Custom Queries:** For more advanced use, consider allowing users to provide their own SQL `SELECT` query to define the exact data to be ingested.

- **Data Chunking:** Once you have the text from a row, you'll need to process it through your existing data parsing and chunking logic before feeding it to an embedding model.

  

**3. Orchestration and Scheduling:**

- **Goal:** How and when to run the ingestion process.

- **Research Topics:**

- **Manual Trigger:** Start with a simple API endpoint like `POST /connectors/{connector_id}/sync` that a user can click from the UI.

- **Background Tasks (Celery, ARQ):** For long-running ingestion jobs, you should not block the API. Research Python background task queues like `Celery` (more established) or `ARQ` (simpler, built for asyncio).

- **Scheduled Syncs (APScheduler):** To automatically keep the knowledge base up-to-date, look into scheduling libraries like `APScheduler` to run syncs on a recurring basis (e.g., nightly).

### Phase 3: Frontend Interface

  

A user-friendly frontend is required for a non-technical content manager.

  

**1. Framework and Component Libraries:**

- **Goal:** Choose tools to build the UI efficiently.

- **Technologies to consider:**

- **Framework:** React, Vue, or Svelte are modern choices.

- **Component Library:** Use a pre-built library to create a professional-looking UI quickly. Look at **Material-UI (MUI)** for React, or **Bootstrap**.

  

**2. UI/UX Workflow:**

- **Goal:** Design the user journey for adding a new data source.

- **Key UI Components to design:**

- A **list view** showing all configured data sources.

- A **form** for creating/editing a data source. It should include fields for all connection parameters and a "Test Connection" button.

- After a connection is successful, a **"Data Selection" view** where the user can see the tables discovered via the API and select which one to ingest.

- A **"Sync" button** to trigger the manual ingestion process and show its status (e.g., "Running," "Completed," "Failed").

### Phase 4: Security Considerations (CRITICAL)

  

You will be storing sensitive database credentials. This is the most critical part to get right.

  

**1. Storing Credentials:**

- **Goal:** Never store passwords or secrets in plain text in your database.

- **Research Topics:**

- **Symmetric Encryption:** This is a viable first step. Use the Python **`cryptography`** library (specifically `Fernet`) to encrypt the password before saving it to the database. The encryption key must be stored securely as an environment variable or in a secrets manager, NOT in the database or code.

- **Secrets Management Services:** For a production-grade solution, research dedicated services like **AWS Secrets Manager** or **HashiCorp Vault**. Your application would store a reference to the secret and fetch it at runtime.

  

**2. Access Control:**

- **Goal:** Ensure the database user whose credentials are provided has limited permissions.

- **Best Practices:**

- Strongly advise users to provide credentials for a **read-only database user**. Your application should never need write access to the source database. This is the principle of least privilege.

- **Network Security:**

- Advise users on the importance of firewall rules to ensure only your application's server can connect to their database port.

### Phase 5: Supporting Multiple Databases (Future-Proofing)

  

To avoid writing completely custom code for every new database, you can use tools that provide a layer of abstraction.

  

**1. SQLAlchemy (The Incumbent Solution):**

- **Concept:** SQLAlchemy is not just an ORM; it's a database abstraction toolkit. Its Core component uses a "dialect" system to communicate with various database backends (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, Oracle, MS-SQL, etc.) using the same Python code.

- **Research Topics:**

- **SQLAlchemy Dialects:** Understand how dialects work. For each new database (e.g., MySQL), you would install a new driver (`mysqlclient` or `PyMySQL`) and change the connection string (e.g., `mysql+pymysql://...`). The rest of your data-fetching code using SQLAlchemy Core can remain largely the same.

- **Connection URL format:** Learn the structure of the connection URLs for different backends. Your `DataSourceConnector` model would store these components, and your code would build the appropriate URL at runtime.

  

**2. Singer.io (Open-Source Standard for Data Integration):**

- **Concept:** Singer is not a platform but a specification for how data extraction scripts (called **Taps**) and data loading scripts (called **Targets**) should communicate using JSON. By adhering to this standard, you can mix and match any source with any destination.

- **Why it's relevant:** Instead of writing your own connector logic, you could integrate existing open-source Taps. There are Taps for almost every popular database and SaaS application.

- **Research Topics:**

- **Singer Taps:** Search for pre-built Taps for sources you might support in the future (e.g., `tap-postgres`, `tap-mysql`, `tap-salesforce`).

- **Running a Tap:** Learn how a Singer Tap is invoked. It requires a `config.json` (with credentials) and a `catalog.json` (to select data streams/tables). Your application would be responsible for generating these files and then executing the Tap as a subprocess.

  

**3. Airbyte / Meltano (Data Integration Platforms):**

- **Concept:** These are open-source platforms that are built on the principles of Singer (or are compatible with it). They provide a UI, API, and scheduling for managing a vast library of pre-built connectors.

- **Why it's relevant:** This approach involves offloading the connector logic entirely to a dedicated, battle-tested platform. Your application would interact with the Airbyte/Meltano API instead of the end-database.

- **Research Topics:**

- **Airbyte API:** Explore the Airbyte API for programmatically configuring a new source, selecting streams (tables), and triggering a sync. Your UI would become a "frontend" for the Airbyte API.

- **Meltano:** Meltano is a "DataOps OS" that is more focused on being a CLI-first tool for developers to manage Singer taps and targets within their own projects. It's highly extensible.

- **Trade-offs:** This approach adds another service to your architecture, which increases operational complexity. However, it dramatically accelerates your ability to support hundreds of different data sources.
