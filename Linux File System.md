**In Linux, everything is a file!**

**'/'** is the main directory that contains everything in Linux. 

1. **bin**
   bin contains the basic binaries, which are basically applications. *ls, cat* are actually stored here. 

2. **sbin**
   sbin contains the system binaries, that a system admin would use. Standard user wouldn't have access to these.
