**In Linux, everything is a file!**

**'/'** is the main directory that contains everything in Linux. 

1. **bin**
   bin contains the basic binaries, which are basically applications. *ls, cat* are actually stored here. 

2. **sbin**
   sbin contains the system binaries, that a system admin would use. Standard user wouldn't have access to these.

 Both of these folders contain the files that need to accessible when running in*single user mode.* **Single user mode** is a special mode that boots you in as a root user to allow you to do system repairs and upgrades or testing.

 3. **boot**boot contains everything the OS needs to boot. The bootloader lives here. *You don't want to touch this folder.*
