	#### Suppose you have a JSON file like:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Turmeric",
    "summary": "Turmeric is a yellow spice known for its anti-inflammatory properties.",
    "benefits": ["Reduces inflammation", "Boosts immunity", "Improves skin health"]
	  }, 
  {
    "title": "Ginger",
    "summary": "Ginger is a root with strong antioxidant properties.",
    "benefits": ["Aids digestion", "Fights nausea", "Reduces pain"]
  }
]

```

###### Your Goal: Enable your RAG system to retrieve relevant chunks like:

"What are the benefits of turmeric?"


### Step 1: Flatten & Chunk the JSON

Convert the JSON entries to retrievable text chunks.
```python
docs = []
for item in json_data:
	content = f"Title: {item['title']}\nSummary: {item['summary']\n....}"
	docs.append(content)
```

Resulting text chunks:
```text
Title: Turmeric
Summary: Turmeric is a yellow spice known for its anti-inflammatory properties.
Benefits: Reduces inflammation, Boosts immunity, Improves skin health
```


### Step 2: Embed the chunks

Use an embedding model to turn the chunks into vectors.
```python
from openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectors = embeddings.embed_documents(docs)
```

Or use SentenceTransformer from HuggingFace
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
vectors = model.encode(docs)
```


### Step 3: Store in a Vector Database

Use a vector store like: FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, etc.
```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

dimension = vectors.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.app(np.array(vectors))
```



### Step 4: Use a RAG Pipeline

**At runtime,**
###### 1. User Query -> Embedding
```python
query_embedding = model.encode(["What are the benefits of turmeric?"])
```

###### 2. Search vector store
```python
D, I = index.search(np.array(query_embedding), k=3)
results = [docs[i] for i in I[0]]
```

###### 3. Pass to LLM with prompt
```python
prompt = f"Context: \n{results[0]}\n\nQuestion: What are the benefits of turmeric?"
response = llm(prompt)
```
