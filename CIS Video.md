#### Four core themes you have to talk about

It's not enough to say: this is what I did. You have to explain why did you choose that method

##### 1. Software Design Principles
   - How logically you've organized code into components (low coupling and high cohesion)
   - How well organized is your code?
   - Are the different parts of the program neatly separated, each doing its own specific job without getting tangled up?
   - **Critically discuss the structure of your code .. while considering alternative approaches**

##### 2. Event-Driven Programming
- How your app responds to user actions and the mechanisms you've built to handle them.
- It's all about how your game reacts to the player.
- A key press, a mouse click, what happens next, you need to show them the code that is listening for those actions and the event handlers that jump in to make things happen.
- **Justify the approach taken when implementing events and event handler into your software.**
- You have to explain why did you choose that method for handling events. What were the pros of doing it your way? That's the deeper thinking they are looking for.

##### 3. Interoperability
- How your code communicates with the external software, specifically the 'Heart Game' API.
- You have to explain how your code sends out requests to that web service and what it does with the information it gets back.

##### 4. Virtual Identity
- This is all about security.
- How do you know who is playing your game?
- How your code uses authentication mechanisms like passwords or cookies to securely identify a user.
- How are you handling logins?
- Are you using cookies? 
- You have to break down the authentication system you've built.


### Difference between the talk that gets you a full marks to a talk that gets you a pass.

### THE RED FLAGS
Mistakes that wreck your grades.

**If you make any of these mistakes, your grade gets an automatic cap.**

This assignment isn't just a coding test. It's a **communication test**.

The video must be authentic.. it should be obvious that the video reflects your understanding...
