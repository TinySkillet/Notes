#### 🎯 **Main Task**

Develop a **game** using the Heart Game API and produce a video discussing your implementation in relation to **four key themes**:

1. **Software Design Principles** (Low Coupling & High Cohesion)
2. **Event-Driven Programming**
3. **Interoperability**
4. **Virtual Identity**

You may use any programming language. Java and JavaScript examples are provided.
